        <h1>New Advances in Physics</h1>
        <h2>Turning Gold into Lead</h2>
        In a startling breakthrough, scientist B.O. "Gus" Fizzics has invented a <strong>practical</strong> technique for transmutation! For more details, please see <a href="give-us-your-gold.html">our transmutation thesis</a>.
        <h2>Perpetual Inactivity Machine</h2>
        In a radical approach that turned traditional attempts to develop perpetual motion machines on their heads, Prof. Fizzics has developed a verified, bona fide perpetual inaction machine. To purchase your own for only $99.00 (plus $43.29 shipping and handling), please see our order form.
